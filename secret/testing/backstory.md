# Chapter 1
Henry Williams, a worker of Freddy Fazbear's Entertainment, had just parked his car outside of the store. He was a robotics designer, in charge of creating and managing the designs for the animatronics. Today was a very happy day, as Henry was about to test his latest design, a dog. Henry opened the door and took a quiet breath, as he saw his new creation standing in front of him. Another person followed closely behind him. "Daddy - what's that?" asked the kid. Henry responded with, "Daddy's new creation. Go on, I'll turn him on." With one press, Cookie sprung to life. "H-h-h-hey everybody! I'm Cookie, your new best friend!" The boy backed off a little, but then got closer. The dog quickly asked, "What's your name?" When the kid didn't respond, Cookie grabbed the kid by the shirt, and said in a demonic voice, "it was me." Before Cookie could harm him, though, Henry punched the on button and Cookie turned off, causing the kid to fall to the floor in fright.
