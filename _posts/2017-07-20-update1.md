# First Update
I'm happy to say that we've made progress on the game. First of all, we've created the security camera system, as it is important to a FnAF game like this.
We've also began working on the model for Cookie, the animatronic. We'd show pictures, but Cookie is just a ball with a square and four cylinders.
We're also gonna include some easter eggs.
## The Storyline
I should probably tell you about the storyline. It's been a pretty long time since Fazbear's was last open. It was left to slowly rot away, and has been
subject to arson. The landlord hires a security guard to prevent any more burnings, but finds out about unexposed events that occured at that place,
including a malprogrammed animatronic named Cookie, who attempts to grab kids and stuff them in their suit. Cookie was locked away in a basement, but escaped, around
the same time a child went missing.
## Other Info
When the game is released in it's ALPHA phase, it will be paid access. However, those who buy the game in early access will always have the game,
even when Beta and Full come out. By the way, there were pawprints.
